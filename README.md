Concrete surface cracks are major defect in civil structures. Building Inspection which is done for the evaluation of rigidity and tensile strength of the building. Crack detection plays a major role in the building inspection, finding the cracks and determining the building health. This project train a CNN model using Pytorch to indentify surface crack. The model has achived over 99% accurancy. The dataset is at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection/data
